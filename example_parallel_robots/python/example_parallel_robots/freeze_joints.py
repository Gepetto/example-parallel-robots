    '''
    Reduce the model by freezing specified joints.

    Arguments:
        model (pinocchio.Model): Pinocchio robot model.
        constraint_models (list): List of Pinocchio robot constraint models.
        actuation_model: Robot actuation model.
        visual_model (pinocchio.VisualModel): Pinocchio robot visual model.
        collision_model (pinocchio.CollisionModel): Pinocchio robot collision model.
        index_to_lock (list): Indexes of the joints to lock.
        reference (numpy.array): Reference configuration to reduce the model from. Fixed joints will have their reference configuration fixed. Default is None.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - reduced_model (pinocchio.Model): Reduced Pinocchio robot model.
            - reduced_constraint_models (list): Reduced Pinocchio robot constraint models list.
            - reduced_actuation_model: Reduced robot actuation model.
            - reduced_visual_model (pinocchio.VisualModel): Reduced Pinocchio robot visual model.
            - reduced_collision_model (pinocchio.CollisionModel): Reduced Pinocchio robot collision model.
