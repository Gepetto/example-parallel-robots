# Toolbox Parallel Robots
This repository includes usefull functions for working with robots with rigid bilateral contacts.

This was originally designed for working with closed kinematic loop by considering open loop models extended with contact constraints.
This package provides a convention to describe actuation of such robots and is the base of another package providing example models of parallel robots.
